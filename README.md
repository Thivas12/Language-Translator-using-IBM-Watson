# Language-Translator-using-IBM-Watson
Lets take a scenario where I am having a hotel at Auroville, Pondicherry with large French-speaking-population. While most communication will happen in English, there is a scope for personal touch if French is used in communication. So basically we will develop a chatbot for the clients right? That's where this project comes in. Using IBM Watson we can create a Language Translator with the services they provide.

# Project Breakdown

* We have to create an instance of Watson Language Translator service in IBM Cloud

* Create Python Server Side (which can be seen in the code files I attached in the repo)

* Deploy the server application so that it is accessible through browser

# What is IBM Watson?

IBM Watson is a data analytics processor that uses natural language processing, a technology that analyzes human speech for meaning and syntax. IBM Watson performs analytics on vast repositories of data that it processes to answer human-posed questions, often in a fraction of a second. IBM Watson’s cognitive and analytical capabilities enable it to respond to human speech, process vast stores of data, and return answers to questions that companies could never solve before. As new data is entered into Watson’s data repository, it uses machine learning that is the product of the processing it performs during analytics to continue to increase its knowledge of subject areas, and the insight it is capable of delivering to users.
